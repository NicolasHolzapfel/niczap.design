        </h2>
        <div class="col2">
            <p>Thinking beyond UI design, I aimed to build a shared, holistic view of the full user experience. I
                noticed that valuable insights, often held by individuals in support and account management, weren’t
                reaching the wider team. I took the initiative to capture and share this knowledge, helping the company
                better understand and serve its users.

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="col1">Database of user issues
        </h2>
        <div class="col2">
            <p>I combined this with insights from my own user interviews and platform usage data to build a
                comprehensive database of UX issues. This allowed me to identify and rank the most critical problems and
                propose a focused strategy to address them.

        <h2 class="col1">Learning-curve as the no. 1 UX issue
        </h2>
        <div class="col2">
            <p>56% of users cited the steep learning curve (or lack of time/motivation to overcome it) as their biggest
                barrier — above any missing feature or technical bug. The less technical the user, the less satisfied
                they were.

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="col1">Tech writing to the rescue
        </h2>
        <div class="col2">
            <p>The core challenge was a decade-old, complex Python library at the heart of the platform. I successfully
                pushed for hiring a small tech-writing team to create step-by-step beginner tutorials. To deepen my own
                understanding, I learned basic Python and wrote several of the first guides myself.

        <h2 class="col1">Prioritisation</h2>
        <div class="col2">
            <p>Overhauling all documentation was impossible, so I focused on the asset classes most critical to our
                users and business (futures, FX, volatility, swaps, equities). By designing game-like onboarding
                journeys for these five, new users could get started quickly — and be motivated to explore the rest
                through standard docs.

            <h2 class="col1">Content principles
            </h2>
            <p>To shape the learning experience, I defined five principles inspired by gaming UX.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col2">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Puzzles, not walkthroughs:</strong> Minimise reading — let users learn by doing. Keep text to the essentials, with explainers reserved for reference and advanced topics.

                </li>
                <li><strong>Hide complexity:</strong>Introduce one narrow concept per puzzle. Keep extra detail hidden to avoid overwhelming users.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Make me think</strong> (but not too much): Require enough thought to grasp the concept, but keep puzzles achievable — too much difficulty demotivates.

                </li>
                <li><strong>Build anticipation:</strong> Motivate users by previewing outcomes (e.g. “by the end you’ll…” or screenshots of what they’ll produce).

                </li>
                <li><strong>Clear progress:</strong> Provide instant feedback and a visible sense of advancement as users move through the journey.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <h2 class="col1">The student to usability test pipeline
        </h2>
        <div class="col2">
            <p>To keep improving the experience, I set up regular usability testing by offering free platform access to
                financial engineering students in exchange for participating in observed sessions. This provided
                valuable insight into the critical first hour of the user journey and helped uncover early friction
                points that weren't visible through internal use alone.

                <h2>Wins</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The initiative to break siloes and share user insights was a success—even account managers
                        realised they’d incorrectly assumed others had the same customer knowledge they held.
                    </li>
                    <li>The project drove a major improvement in documentation quality, setting a new standard for
                        future product launches.
                    </li>
                    <li>User feedback on the new tutorials was highly positive, with beginners reporting a smoother,
                        less intimidating onboarding experience.

                <ul>
                    <li>The comprehensive user-issue database remained a one-off effort rather than becoming a sustained
                        process, as teams had differing priorities and shifting workflows.
                    </li>
                    <li>Many more problems were documented than addressed, highlighting the need to better align
                        insights with delivery capacity.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tutorial production moved slower than expected, highlighting the importance of aligning
                        expertise and resourcing early.
