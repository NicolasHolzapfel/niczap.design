        <h2 class="col1">Context</h2>
        <div class="col2">
            <p>DaVe is a web app for detecting anomalies in datasets. I co-designed the full experience in a
                cross-functional team, from shaping the MVP to refining the final interface.</p>

            <p><strong>Team:</strong> PM, 2 designers, 1 technical writer, 1 QA, ~4 software engineers, ~3 data
                engineers, and strong CEO
                involvement.</p>

            <p><strong>Business case:</strong> SigTech mainly bought raw data, cleaning and aggregating it for
                data-consumers. If we gave
                data owners a tool to rapidly validate and improve their datasets before selling, it wouldn’t just
                create a new revenue stream — it would also save our data team time and improve the experience for
                data-consumers, creating a virtuous cycle for the whole business.</p>

            <p><em>('DaVe' = Data Validation Engine!)</em></p>

        <h2 class="col1">Requirements gathering
        </h2>
        <div class="col2">
            <p>Collaborating with the PM and CEO, I captured the core requirements in a written spec — a crucial step in
                surfacing hidden differences in our assumptions about our users, especially their level of technical
                knowledge.</p>

            <p>Next, I wireframed the end-to-end journey that guided engineers plans for the build. Early concepts
                included letting users edit anomalies as well as detect them, but we quickly realised this was too
                ambitious for an MVP to be launched in only weeks. We scaled back to detection-only.</p>

        <div class="col2">
            <p>This was the product’s first product UI expression of our recent rebrand, so visual clarity and brand
                alignment were key. To support this, we designed, from scratch, a library of Figma components using
                atomic design principles.

            <p>With the core flow and aesthetic validated, we moved on to designing all edge cases, minor UIs, and UI
                states. We stayed at least one sprint ahead by working closely with engineers throughout.

                <h2>Wins</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strong cross-functional collaboration across design, engineering, product, and QA.</li>
                    <li>Fast development of first rebranded product UI.
                    </li>
                    <li>Early investment in a design system paid off, accelerating the next project.

                    <li>Saw initial traction (but ultimately neglecged as company pivoted to AI with the release of ChatGPT plugins (now custom

                <ul>
                    <li>Some wireframe reviews lacked thoroughness — e.g. the sequence of backend calls involved was
                        missed — leading to avoidable rework during UI design.</li>
                    <li>The initial MVP scope was too ambitious, causing inefficiencies as wireframes had to be revised
                        midstream.</li>
