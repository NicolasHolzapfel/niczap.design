        <div class="col2">
            <p>I joined SigTech as the founding designer and built a design and content team from scratch, focused on
                improving the platform used daily by professional quants to develop algorithmic trading strategies.

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="col1">A proliferative kitchen sink of a design
        </h2>
        <div class="col2">
            <p>At the centre of the SigTech platform is a deep Python library developed over many years. The web UI for
                accessing it had evolved ad-hoc, without branding or design strategy. I began by interviewing internal
                and external users to understand how each part of the UI was being used (or not used).

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="col1">→ Comprehensive rebrand & redesign
        </h2>
        <div class="col2">
            <p>With a clear understanding of how each UI was used, I led a structured redesign focused on usability and
                hierarchy. A major issue was the lack of structure—app-wide tools were mixed in with project-specific
                features on the same screens, making navigation confusing. I reorganised key layouts to better reflect
                how users worked across the platform. I also unified the platform’s visual language, which later evolved
                further as we rebranded the product more broadly.

                    <li>Created an intuitive information architecture that clarified how different features relate to

                    <li>Some UIs were used with high frequency, making speed just as critical as clarity. I initially
                        under-prioritised this.
                    </li>
                    <li>The data browser design would have been stronger had I developed a deeper understanding of
                        financial instruments earlier; this knowledge came later in my time at SigTech
