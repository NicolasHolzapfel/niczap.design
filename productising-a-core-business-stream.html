            <p class="col2">Demand for Sylvera’s early-stage market expertise was surging, but the solution lived
                entirely
                offline in CSVs and PDFs — making it hard to scale or sell as a renewing subscription. Our five-person
                squad
                (GM, PM, myself as designer, & 2 engineers) set out to bring these insights into the platform as a core,
                interactive feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our first step was exploring how text-heavy, ~50-page reports could be turned into experiences worthy of
                a
                modern SaaS platform.

                To reduce cognitive load and move away from the PDFs’ “wall of data” approach, I surfaced key insights
                through charts and interactions, deferring technical detail to tooltips and footnotes for on-demand
                access.

                The exploratory phase ended with a tough reality: an engineer-light squad and impending quarterly goals.
                To deliver as quickly as possible, we focused the MVP on bringing a CSV of early-stage project data into
                the platform as an interactive table. Relatively unglamorous, but the right decision:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The content would be continuously added-to, driving logins and justifying subscriptions.</li>
                <li>We could reuse existing frontend components, giving the best return on limited engineering resource.</li>

                <p>
                    Leveraging a flexible, front-end-aligned table component I’d recently designed for the Sylvera design system, I was able to help deliver a scalable UI for the catalogue in record time. I streamlined the layout by merging related CSV fields into multi-element columns — minimising horizontal scrolling and making side-by-side comparison effortless.
                </p>
               
                <p>Column order was optimised around the decisions users needed to make once they’d narrowed their list to a shortlist, ensuring the most relevant data was always in view.</p>
                <p>Ideally, we’d have shipped an alternative card view for scannability, but speed-of-delivery had to win out.</p>

            Catalogue filters used sliders — often a source of frustration. To avoid this, I defined their behaviour in detail, from increment scale to micro-interactions. The result was a seamless flow that kept users focused on exploring opportunities, not wrestling with controls.

                Where possible, the early-stage project page design mirrored the mature-project structure while
                accommodating its unique data points. I used the opportunity to harmonise all existing project page
                designs,
                distilling seven distinct page types into a single flexible design-plus-frontend responsive component.
                This
                cut design and engineering overhead and sped up later dev cycles.

                <h2>Wins</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our OKR was three early-stage sales in the quarter. With the productised experience launched, we
                        more than doubled that — closing seven deals and proving the value of the strategy.</li>
                    <li>The harmonised project page component cut dev and design cycles and improved UX consistency
                        across the platform.</li>
                    <li>The project was such a success that the company org structure was overhauled to replicate
                        the success of our team.</li>
            </div>
            <div class="equalcolumn">
                <h2>Learnings</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The original design vision was overly ambitious, forcing large scope cuts to deliver an MVP
                        within the quarter. I could have anticipated this and invested less polish and detail in the
                        initial exploratory designs.</li>
                    <li>Embedding filters in column headers would have made the table cleaner and easier to use. The
                        above-table placement came from the original vision, which allowed for switching between table
                        and card views with shared filters above both. In hindsight, I could have anticipated that
                        competing priorities might drop the card view, and focused on perfecting the table experience
                        from the start.</li>
